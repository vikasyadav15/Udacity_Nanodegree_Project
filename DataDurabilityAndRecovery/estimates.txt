Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage :An RTO of less then 5 mins for this incident would be reasonable since We have another read replicate in different AZ .
Minimum RTO for a single region outage :An RTO less then 10 mins for this incident would be reasonable since we have secondary region with read replica, to do failover we need some time in different region .
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage:An RPO of less then 1 mins  should be fine since  We have multi AZ cluster with read replica and secondary mysql will be always in sync with master hence there won't be any data loss.
Minimum RPO for a single region outage:An RPO of less than 5 mins  should be fine since we are taking backup and snapshot of database and also We have multi Region cluster with read replica.
